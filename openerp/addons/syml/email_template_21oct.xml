               <p>Hello ${object.partner_id.name} </p>
<p>We are contacting you because ${object.referred_source.partner_id.name or ''}
${object.referred_source.partner_id.last_name or ''} let us know you are exploring
mortgage options. Finding the best financing can be a time and effort consuming
challenge because there are thousands of different mortgage products available
in Canada.  Many people go to a bank however, this effectively limits their
"shopping options" to only that bank’s mortgages.  Others try a Mortgage Broker,
but again, the options are often limited to the 2-4 lenders the broker knows well
(even though they have access to more).</p>

<p>Alternatively, at Visdom Mortgage Solutions, your Mortgage Application is
underwritten by our Proprietary Mortgage Platform across 100s to 1000s of
potential mortgage products.  The result is a simple, clean, understandable
proposal for the customers which contains only the best mortgages in Canada
which suit the your goals of reducing cost, managing risk and providing flexibility.
This process help you decrease costs of borrowing and better achieve the lifestyle
and financial goals.</p>

<p>In order to begin the process, please click on the link below.  It will take
you to a secure, protected Mortgage Application which only takes most people
5 - 10 minutes to complete.  Your  access link is provided below.</p>

        <p><b><u>Relationship and Compensation Disclosure:</u></b><br/>
        To better assist our borrowers in understanding the relationship and
        compensation with Mortgage Brokerages, we have outlined the following
        information for your review.</p>
        <p>For a variety of reasons, a mortgage professional may not always be
        able to obtain the lowest rate or best terms in the marketplace for a
        particular borrower. It can be dependent upon the terms of the purchase
        contract, type of property, property value, borrowers employment status,
        borrowers financial position, and credit history are examples of some
        factors that may affect rates or terms.</p>

        <p>The mortgage brokerage and its representative’s role and obligations
        to the borrower and the lender will vary depending on the nature of the
        service relationship between the mortgage brokerage as well as the lender
        or borrower. This is not intended to be an all inclusive list however in
        general terms it best describes the mortgage brokerage's role and
        resulting obligations to you. You are strongly encouraged to discuss
        this document with your mortgage brokerage representative and ask any
        questions you may have.</p>

        <p>A mortgage broker can be described as the mastermind between a borrower
        and a lender with the goal of originating a mortgage loan. Typically,
        a mortgage broker draws from a pool of various lenders to find the right
        match; however, it is important to know that some mortgage brokers only
        do business with one lender.</p>

        <p>We, as a Mortgage Brokerage, will act as an INTERMEDIARY between the
        borrower and the lender(s) who have authorized us to offer their mortgage
        products to borrowers who are seeking a mortgage. Some of our duties to
        the borrower are to be honest, exercise reasonable care and skill, gather
        your intended property and financial information to determine the lending
        options available to you, disclose and explain appropriate options for
        your consideration, completed and submit documentation to the lender,
        and keep you informed of the progress of your application.  Some of our
        duties to the lender are to be honest, exercise reasonable care and skill,
        complete and submit documentation to the lender, disclose what steps were
        taken to verify information and documentation as part of the application
        process, and keep the lender informed of the progress of the application.
        The products this brokerage will offer will be from Multiple Lenders.</p>

        <p>The brokerage and its brokers will be compensated for this mortgage
        transaction by way of commission/income or fee paid directly by the lender
        and, as well,  may also receive monies or non-monetary benefits from the
        lender which can include additional commission of income based on volume
        of business with a particular lender.</p>

        <p>As outlined above, there is a variety of options in obtaining a
        mortgage, however if,  for some reason the brokerage must charge you
        a fee to arrange your mortgage there may be no refund. When obtaining
        a mortgage there can be additional fees that you might be required to
        pay such as: property appraisal, default mortgage insurance, title
        insurance, legal fees, etc. </p>


        <p>The brokerage will be paying
